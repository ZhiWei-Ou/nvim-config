--- Lua language server.
---
--- `lua-language-server` can be installed by following the instructions [here](https://luals.github.io/#neovim-install).
---
--- The default `cmd` assumes that the `lua-language-server` binary can be found in `$PATH`.
---
--- If you primarily use `lua-language-server` for Neovim, and want to provide completions,
--- analysis, and location handling for plugins on runtime path, you can use the following
--- settings.
---
--- See `lua-language-server`'s [documentation](https://luals.github.io/wiki/settings/) for an explanation of the above fields:
--- * [Lua.runtime.path](https://luals.github.io/wiki/settings/#runtimepath)
--- * [Lua.workspace.library](https://luals.github.io/wiki/settings/#workspacelibrary)
