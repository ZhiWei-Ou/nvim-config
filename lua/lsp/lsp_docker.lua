--- `docker-langserver` can be installed via `npm`:
--- ```sh
--- npm install -g dockerfile-language-server-nodejs
--- ```
---
--- Additional configuration can be applied in the following way:
--- ```lua
--- vim.lsp.config('dockerls', {
---     settings = {
---         docker = {
--- 	    languageserver = {
--- 	        formatter = {
--- 		    ignoreMultilineInstructions = true,
--- 		},
--- 	    },
--- 	}
---     }
--- })
--- ```

---@type vim.lsp.Config
return {
    name = 'dockerls',
    opts = {
        cmd = { 'docker-langserver', '--stdio' },
        filetypes = { 'dockerfile' },
        root_markers = { 'Dockerfile' },
        on_init = function (client, init_result)
            client.alias_name = 'Docker(dockerls)'
        end
    }
}
